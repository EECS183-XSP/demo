                               Saint Tropez has been listed by multiple publications as the best French restaurant 
                               in the city, and I agree. Everything here just tastes so fresh and clean, it's amazing how they 
                               can turn simple ingredients into such amazing flavors. I love to get seafood here, try something new! 
                               They won't disappoint.
                           </p>

                               I love sea food and how diffeerent cultures cook it - St.Tropez is probably the best place in the city for 
                               authentic French seafood. Some of my favorite things on their (very French) menu - Pieuvre Grillée (grilled octopus 
                               $16), Daube Provencale (traditional beef stew $22), the Truffle Mac & Cheese ($22), and the Risotto d’Orge aux Champignon 
                               (risotto with three types of mushrooms, $22).

                                I first came to Raku with two of my friends on a food crawl in the East Village, funnily enough I didn't get ramen or udon but had rice. 
                                This place has been listed as the number 1 udon place in the city over and over again, and it truly is that good. The 
                                seating is limited and they are almost always busy, but the wait is definitely worth it! *They are cash only! 
                            </p>
                            <p class = "hightlights"> 
                                Some of my favorite things on their menu include the chicken tatsua-age (japanese marinated fried chicken, $11/18), unatama don (eel + egg rice bowl), 
                                the kamonan udon (with duck, $21), and the gyunan udon (with washugyu beef, $20). They also have a variety of cold noodles to try for those hot summer days. 
                                Definitely take a chance here, you won't be disappointed!
